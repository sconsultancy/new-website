                ZeeTV Show MANMOHINI. In MITHAI i am playing an integral part
                and prominent role of Animesh Mishra. My son will be married to
                the lead boy&apos;s sister.

                I am making a comeback to TV after my stint with Manmohini. This
                is my first work after the Covid breakout. I am grateful to the
                channel for giving me this opportunity. Producer/ Director
                Arvind Babbal Sir and Casting Director Darpan Srivastavji have
                given me a very delightful role, and I look forward to this
                stint. Mine will be a positive character. One of my sons is
                married to the main lead&apos;s sister. My other son is on the
                verge of getting married to the other daughter from the same
                house.So this family of mine will play a huge part in the
                narrative.
